## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about positioning, this part of CSS is still confusing, but I want to understand them from project to project that I build.

### Continued development

I want to refactoring the code, especially the CSS codes. I think I can stil reduce the amount of the code. Improve my skill and use better solution.

### Useful resources

- [](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning) - This helped me to learn about positioning.
